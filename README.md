# Medical Image Processing Application

Medical image processing involves using algorithms to analyze and extract information from images generated by medical imaging modalities. Fundamentally, this application functions as an advanced diagnostic tool for medical professionals. It's like a smart tool for doctors, processing complex images from MRI or CT scans to identify subtle issues or confirm diagnoses accurately. It also helps plan treatments by giving detailed insights into patient anatomy. Ultimately, it aims to improve healthcare by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness. This project combines a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend, providing a full-stack web application solution.
